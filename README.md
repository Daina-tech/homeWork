## I am a student at SavvyCoders. I am a mother of three wonderful children and a Kansas City native. I love to travel, ride bikes, and explore. I am currently learning how to code.

* I want to learn more how to code.
* I want to learn the JavaScript language.
* I want to learn more about the back end of web development.
* I want to gain more insight into the front end of web development.
